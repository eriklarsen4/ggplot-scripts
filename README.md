Volcano plots, Heatmaps

"Bioinformatics" contains markdowns along with the appropriate data and graphs of heatmaps and volcano plots generated. It also includes a step-by-step of an advanced ggplot-derived volcano plot.

It will slowly grow to include the graphical outputs (MA plots, various bar graphs) I generated by analyzing neurons of mutant mice for my doctoral work.

Might include some proteomics scatter plots.

"Binomial-Heatmap" contains a geom_tile-style ggplot of some of the genes differentially expressed in our mutant mouse model that are involved in multiple cellular and molecular pathways and processes.
